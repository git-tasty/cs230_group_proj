This is just to clear a few things up about how our program works so you don't have to
go through with trial and error to figure out how our program is supposed to function
(thank us later, Chief).

Anyway, there are 3 different ways to login. As a customer, as a tech, and as the manager.

Want to see what the whole program can do? Here are the steps you have to take:

1. Create an account as a Customer.
2. Create a Ticket as a Customer.
3. Create an account as a Technician.
4. Login as that Technician
5. Claim the Ticket you created when you were a Customer.
6. Complete the same ticket as a Technician.
7. Log Out.
8. Login as Manager/Chief.
9. Close the Ticket you Completed as a Technician.

Bam.

That's it. Hopefully this made navigating our program a little easier.

Thanks for reading!
